# FCL_motif
In this notebook, we will see how FCL relates to the fractions of motives in food webs.
We use the empirical food webs in the Cohen's database.
The summary csv file is uploaded.
We analyze two types of FCL: based on the longest path or the shortest path, respectively.
FCL based on the mean prey's trphic levels is omitted as we need to re-assign species indeces, which is not easy right now.
